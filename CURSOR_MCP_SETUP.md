# Cursor MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup for Render

## âœ… Configuration Complete

I've successfully set up the Cursor MCP configuration for Render integration at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`.

### Configuration Details

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "render": {
      "url": "https://mcp.render.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer rnd_CcvyeeFeXwx3Xoozp2i9dydIfrcT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### What This Enables

With this MCP configuration, you can now:

1. **Direct Render Integration**: Cursor can now interact with Render services directly
2. **Deploy from Cursor**: Deploy your applications to Render without leaving the editor
3. **Manage Services**: Create, update, and monitor Render services
4. **Database Management**: Create and manage PostgreSQL databases on Render
5. **Environment Variables**: Set and manage environment variables for your services
6. **Logs and Monitoring**: View logs and monitor your deployed services

### How to Use

After restarting Cursor, you should be able to:

- Ask Cursor to deploy your app to Render
- Request database creation and configuration
- Manage environment variables
- Monitor service health and logs
- Update deployed services

### Example Commands You Can Now Use

- "Deploy this app to Render with a PostgreSQL database"
- "Create a new database on Render for this project"
- "Check the status of my deployed services"
- "Update the environment variables for my Render service"
- "Show me the logs from my deployed app"

### Next Steps

1. **Restart Cursor** to load the new MCP configuration
2. **Test the integration** by asking Cursor to help with Render operations
3. **Deploy your app** using the new MCP capabilities

### Troubleshooting

If the MCP integration doesn't work:

1. Verify the configuration file exists at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
2. Check that your API key is correct
3. Restart Cursor completely
4. Check Cursor's logs for any MCP-related errors

### API Key Security

Your Render API key is now stored in the MCP configuration. Keep this file secure and don't share it publicly.
